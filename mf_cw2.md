## Question 1

## Crude Oil Market Outlook for 2023 and beyond

Global liquid fuels markets. Global production of liquid fuels in our forecast reaches an average of 102.8 million barrels per day
(b/d) in 2024, up from 100.0 million b/d in 2022, driven by large growth in non-OPEC production. However, uncertainty over
Russia’s oil supply will persist, particularly in early 2023. We expect that global consumption of liquid fuels will increase from an
average of 99.4 million b/d in 2022 to 102.2 million b/d in 2024. Ongoing concerns about global economic conditions as well as
the easing COVID-19 restrictions in China, however, increase the uncertainty of the outcomes of our demand forecasts. With more
global oil production than consumption in our forecast, we expect global oil inventories will increase over the next two years.

KrisEnergy Company Limited is involved in searching for locations to drill for oil. The company holds oil exploration rights
with 13 licences in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam covering a gross acreage of approximately 33,124
sq. km. It operates nine of the contract areas.

KrisEnergy’s oil portfolio contains two producing assets in the Gulf of Thailand and the onshore gas field in Bangladesh. Nine
contract areas contain a combination of development projects, appraisal targets and exploration prospects.

The company hires professional experts like geoscientists, engineers and operations specialists each have at least 20 years
of experience in the upstream oil and gas industry in South East Asia and have a successful track record across every facet of
the exploration and production (E&P) life cycle. Through the firm’s experience and regional focus, KrisEnergy Company has
firmly established relationships with national governments, service providers and other E&P companies in South East Asia.

With the recent spike in crude oil prices, KrisEnergy Company Ltd is considering restructuring part of their facility for the
production of crude oil product that could help to avoid waste. The project feasibility committee has collated forecasted
investments and financing cash flows and other information for this project. Cost of capital is 12%.

KrisEnergy decided to create a product that could help avoid that waste. The company is appraising the feasibility of
investing in a new production line that converts crude oil into fuel oil and gasoline, the material can be converted to a
variety of products that are used in everyday life. This also helps increase revenues of plastics, detergent, pesticides and
other chemical manufacturers respectively. The following information involves required investment, projected revenues
and expenses, and other information for this project.

<ol type="a">
<li>Core machinery assets and production facilities would have to be acquired and installed. These assets are
estimated to cost $120 million, including installation cost. These would have to be fully paid before
commencement of production.</li>
<li>The proposed production facility will need to re-claim an entire lower floor of the factory building, which is
currently being leased out to a steel product processor, at a monthly rental of $200 000.</li>
<li>The newly acquired assets are expected to have a 10-years useful life, till the next technological disruption. There is
no scrap value at the end of asset’s life. Depreciation on the new assets will be at cost over 10 years using straight
line method.</li>
<li>Annual sales in pounds over the next 8 years are projected to be as follows:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
  <th>Year</th>
  <th>Annual sales<br />
(million kilograms)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1 to 3</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4 to 6</td>
<td>28</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7 to 10</td>
<td>32</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>Production would require increase of working capital of $4 million to finance operations such as inventory purchases.
Current liabilities will also be expected to increase by $1.5 million. This net working capital will be released at the
end of the asset’s life.</li>
<li>Each kilogram of flour would sell for $2.</li>
<li>Monthly fixed expenses (excluding depreciation) is projected at $1.5 million. Included in fixed expenses are
administration, sales and marketing expenses. Variable costs of production would be $0.20 per kilogram.</li>
<li>Krisenergy pays a corporate tax rate of 18%. Capital gain on asset disposal is charged at corporate tax rate.</li>
</ol>

## Case Study 2 – Budgeting Ahead

On 1 Jan 2022, Kris Energy Limited is attempting to conduct cash flow budget through to Mar 31, 2022.
On the latter date, an unsecured note payable for US$4,000,000 with interest rate of 3% per annum.
Such amount was borrowed on 30 Sept 2021 to help the company overcome the seasonal peak in
October through to December 2021. Interest payments are paid monthly.

The company only transacts on credit sales. A discount of 4% is given to all customers who pay within
one month, 30% of the accounts receivable will be received in the month of sale. 50% will be collected
in the following month; and 20% will be received 2 months after sale. There is an 8% provision for bad
debt for accounts receivable owing 2 months after sale.

Below are the Projected and Actual Sales:

<table>
<caption>Sales</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Month</th>
<th>Projected ($)</th>
<th>Actual ($)</th>

<tbody>
{% for sales in site.data.sales_projected_actual %}
<tr>
  <td>{{ sales.month }}</td>
  <td>{{ sales.projected }}</td>
  <td>{{ sales.actual }}</td>
</tr>
{% endfor %}
</tbody>
</table>
Purchases are made on basis of 60% pf the following month’s projected sales. Half of the purchases are
paid for in the month of purchase, and a 5% prompt settlement discount is received. The remainder is
paid in full the following month.

Budgeted fixed operating expenses for the year are $9,000,000. Fixed costs are accrued evenly through
the year. The operating variable costs is determined to be 12% of that month’s projected sales. Both
