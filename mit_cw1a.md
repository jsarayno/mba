## Turnitin

Turnitin will be used in this subject for on-line marking. It provides a correct protocol
for referencing. Hence, assignment must be submitted to Turnitin through the
Blackboard gateway.

After submission, the Turnitin system will process the paper and generate an
Originality Report. Open the Originality Report and check the highlighted sections.
Amendment is necessary if the similarity percentage is above the allowance.
Allowance for plagiarism is <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">15% and below</span>, excluding the list of references.

Originality Report will take a considerably longer time for each resubmission of work
to Turnitin (allocate extra time in your work plan for this). Should there be any instances
where the plagiarism is above 15%, a low or a failure grade will be awarded.

Make sure you use the same username, filename.pdf and submission title for each resubmission. In Portable Document Format (pdf) only.

Please allow at least **48 hours** to generate the originality report.

<span style="color:red;">DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE DATE OF SUBMISSION.</span>
